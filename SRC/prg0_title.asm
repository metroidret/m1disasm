;The following two tables are the data tables for controlling the movement of the sparkle sprites
;in the title routine.  Here's how thw data in the tables work: The first byte is a counter byte.
;It is loaded into a memory address and decremented every frame. Whilt that value is not 0, the
;second byte is used to change the sprite's x and y coordinates in the screen.  The upper 4 bits
;of the second byte are amount to change the y coordinates every frame.  If bit 7 is set, the
;y coordinates of the sprite are reduced every frame by the amount stored in bits 4,5 and 6. The
;lower 4 bits of the second byte are used to change the x coordinates of the sprite in the same
;manner.  If bit 3 is set, the x coordinates of the sprite are reduced every frame by the amount
;stored in bits 0, 1 and 2.
;Special case: If MSB of the first byte is set(in the case of this data, the first byte is #$FF),
;The counter byte is set to only 1 frame and the second byte contains only x coordinates to move
;the sprite.  The y coordinates do not change.  This allows 8 bytes to move the x coordinate
;instead of only 4.  This allows the sprite to "jump" across the edges of the letters. If the MSB
;of the second byte is set, the x coordinate of the sprite is decreased by the amount stored in
;the other seven bytes.

;The following routines are intro routines that are not used in this version of the game.  It

;sprite control mechanism and name table writing routines. The intro routines are a mess! In

;never read.
