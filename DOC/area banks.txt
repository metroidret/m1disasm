# Area ROM Banks

Adapted from: https://github.com/ZaneDubya/MetroidMMC3/blob/master/Documentation/area_banks.txt

## 1. Introduction
The events of Metroid NES occur on the planet Zebes, which is divided into five
distinct Areas: Brinstar, Norfair, Tourian, Kraid's Hideout, and Ridley's
Hideout. The data for each of these Areas is located in a separate 16kb ROM bank
which is loaded at runtime into $8000-$BFFF of the NES address space.

While the main Game Engine ROM bank is relatively well documented, much of the
World ROM banks have not yet been labeled and commented.

Interestingly, about 47% of every Area ROM bank is identical to every other
Area ROM bank, containing common routines and data. Thus, an Area ROM bank may
be separated into the portion that is common to every Area bank ($8000-$8D5F and
$B200-$BFFF) and the portion that is different for each Area bank ($8D60-$B1FF).

    Table 1.1: Area ROM bank portions.
    ROM Addr.       Size in bytes   Name            Documented in...
    $8000-$8D5F     $0D60 (3424)    Common          Section 2
    $8F60-$B1FF     $24A0 (9376)    Area Specific   Section 3
    $B000-$BFFF     $0E00 (3584)    Sound Engine    Section 4

## 2. Common
This portion of the Area ROM bank is common to each Area bank. It begins at
$8000 and runs for $0D60 (3424) bytes. Much of the data in this section has been
documented in the disassembly, but the routines in this section remain
undocumented.

### 2.1 Jump Table
The Jump Table consists of 24 "JMP $XXXX" instructions. These jumps all point to
addresses in the always-present Game Engine bank ($C000-$FFFF) or addresses in
this first Common I section ($8000-$8D5F).

It would be interesting to note where these instructions point to (only a few of
the addresses are currently named/documented), and where these instructions are
called from. What is their purpose?

### 2.2 Zoomer Jump Table

These are 8 16-bit pointers that point to 4 different functions that zoomers
(the crawling enemies) use to move forward. They point the the address of the
function in question minus one, because they are called via the "RTS trick". For
information of this trick, please reference the NESdev wiki:

http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/RTS_Trick

The list of the jump table, in order, is as follows:

    84FE - Move right one pixel
    84A7 - Move left one pixel
    844B - Move down one pixel
    844B - Move down one pixel
    84A7 - Move left one pixel
    84FE - Move right one pixel
    83F5 - Move up one pixel
    83F5 - Move up one pixel

TODO: Verify that that's what those routines actually do
    
### 2.3 Enemy movement routines
There are a number of routines in this section. They all appear to be related to
enemy AI and movement. Names and descriptions of these functions are provisional
given that most enemy variables are still poorly understood.

    8058 - Common Enemy AI handler (called at $F413 in bank 7)
    80B0 - Loads from table at $977B
    
    80B8 - Up movement related function
    80FB - Down movement related
    8134 - Right movement related
    816E - Left movement related
    
    81B1 - SetBit5OfEnData05_AndClearEnData1A
    81B8 - SetBit5OfEnData05
    81C0 - SetBit5OfEnData05_AndClearEnData1B
    
    81C7 - Horizontal acceleration related
    81DA - alternate entry point for the previous function
    81F6 - LoadBit5ofTableAt968B
    81FC - Vertical acceleration related
    820F - alternate entry point for the previous function
    
    822B - Loads pointer to an enemy movement string
    8244 - Vertical Movement Function (handles enemy movement strings)
    8318 - Horizontal Movement Function (also reads enemy movement strings)
    
    833F - Vertical movement related
    8395 - Horizontal movement related
    
    83F5 - Move up one pixel
    844B - Move down one pixel
    84A7 - Move left one pixel
    84FE - Move right one pixel
    
    855A - Switch enemy nametable
    8563 - Get other nametable index for enemy
    856B - XOR EnData05

Note that bank 7 has several more routines that help handle enemies and such.

A good project to eventually do would be to be refactor the enemy movement code
so that it uses acceleration and subpixels, rather than the weird table and
counter approach that it currently uses.
    
### 2.4 Door Routines
These are various routines pertaining to doors.

    8B13 - SamusEnterDoor
    - Some subroutines
    8B79 - DisplayDoors
    - Various subroutines

## 3. Area Specific
This is the largest of the three sections of an Area Specific ROM Bank. It
contains graphics data and routines that area only called in this Area, and a
small amount of common data.

The following parts must be located at these exact addresses, due to code in the
game engine that expects them to be at this location:

    8D60 - CHR data (2kB, does not have to pertain to the area in question)
    
    9560 - Palette Ptr Table
    9598 - Area Pointer Table (8 pointers to things at non-fixed addresses)
    
    95A8 - Tourian Jump Table (RTSes in all other areas)
    95C3 - Area specific routine (jumps to an RTS in all non-Tourian areas)
    
    95C6 - Two's compliment rountine
    
    95CC - Special room value
    95CD - Music init value
    95CE - Base damage value (1 word, little-endian)
    95D0 - Item music room indices (7 byte)
    95D7 - Samus starting position (map X, map Y, screen Y) (no screen X)
    
    95DA - Unknown (palette switching related)
    95DB - Unused byte?
    95DC - Unknown (animation related?)
    95DD - Unknown (animation related?)
    95DE - Unused byte?
    95DF - Unused byte?
    95E0 - Unknown table (animation related?)
    
    95E5 - ChooseEnemyRoutine
    95EB - Enemy AI Jump Table (used by the above routine) (16 entries)
    
    960B - Unknown enemy related table (32 bytes)
    962B - Enemy health table (16 bytes)
    963B - ResetAnimIndex table (32 bytes)
    965B - another ResetAnimIndex table ?? (32 bytes)
    967B - unknown table (16 bytes)
    968B - unknown table (determines enemy hit sound?) (16 bytes)
    969B - EnData05 table ? (16 bytes)
    96AB - unknown enemy-related table (16 bytes)
    96BB - EnemyInitDelayTbl ? (16 bytes)
    96CB - table of indices to a table at 97D1 ? (16 bytes)
    
    96DB - enemy movement pointers (40 words?)
    
    972B - EnData1A table (20 bytes?)
    973F - EnData1B table (20 bytes?)
    9753 - EnData02 (y speed?) table (20 bytes?)
    9767 - EnData03 (x speed?) table (20 bytes?)
    977B - enemy movement behavior table (16 bytes)
    978B - unknown table
    
    97A7 - another table of enemy movement pointers (20 words)
    97D1 - unknown table (length varies between banks)
    
After this point, area-specific data can be located anywhere. This includes:
    - Enemy movement strings
    - Enemy AI routines
    - Area specific routines
    - Enemy animation data tables
    - Enemy sprite drawing pointer tables
    - Enemy sprite placement data tables
    - Palette data
    - Room pointer tables
    - Structure pointer tables
    - Special item tables
    - Room data
    - Metatile data

## 4. Music and Sound Engine

Area specific music typically starts at B000, but doesn't have to.

The music engine starts at B200, and also includes all the general purpose music.

Between the area specific music and the music engine are some random Mother Brain
tiles. These appear to be unused, and are likely a remnant of the original build
process.
